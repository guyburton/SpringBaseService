SpringBaseService
=================

Basic Spring transactional service host configuration.

This is a personal experiment with Spring, integrating a few different technologies. It's sometimes hard to find examples of specific configurations like this, so thought it was worth sharing.

* Eclipselink JPA
* H2 Embedded Database
* Atomikos standalone JTA Transaction Manager
* Spring application context & IoC
* Spring Data (repository)
* Spring Test
* Apache CXF JAX-RS web server (REST)
* Apache CXF Web Client JAX-RS REST client
